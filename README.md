# javascript-challenge
HW 14

This was a fun homework to get the basic fundamentals of javascript down. 

I ran into issues changing the filepaths to reference into the 'UFO-level-1' folder, so I left the route in the index file connected to the 'static' folder. The functionality is the same and it runs properly. 

Since I couldn't figure out my issue with the file paths, I created the filters on the index file, but never got around to actually creating the loop for the filter criteria. Nonetheless, the homework satisfies the requirements for the required 'Level 1' portion.
